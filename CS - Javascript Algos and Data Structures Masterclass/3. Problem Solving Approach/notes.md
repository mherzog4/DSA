# Intro to problem solving

OBJECTIVES

Define what an algorithm is
Devise a plan to solve algorithms
Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?
A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

Why do I need to know this?
Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm!

It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer

## Step 1: Understand the problem

### UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?

- What are the inputs that go into the problem?

- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)

- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Step 2 concrete examples

EXPLORE EXAMPLES
Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better

Examples also  provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should

EXPLORE EXAMPLES
Start with Simple Examples
Progress to More Complex Examples
Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs
Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

## Step 3: Break it down
BREAK IT DOWN
Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.

SOLVE THE PROBLEM

If you can't...

SOLVE A SIMPLER PROBLEM!


## Step 4: Solve or Simplify

SIMPLIFY

Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
Temporarily ignore that difficulty
Write a simplified solution
Then incorporate that difficulty back in


## Step 5: look back and refactor

REFACTORING QUESTIONS
Can you check the result?
Can you derive the result differently?
Can you understand it at a glance?
Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
Can you improve the performance of your solution?
Can you think of other ways to refactor?
How have other people solved this problem?

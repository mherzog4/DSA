# Binary search

## Search array

binary search is an algo is very related to sorting - it can only run on a input that is in a sorted order

very similiar to dictionary and how yo u look up words

important that the input is in sorted order bc if its not then you cant run  binary search

left and right pointer make up two boundaries to make our search space and dive by 2 gets the middle index of the array

with binary search with every iteration you eliminate a lot of the remianing values until you have a single value

## Search range

when you have to guess a number within a range but dont hve explicit numbers

1-100 range

search range of values where the n value satisifies the condtions

n = secret number you are trying to guess

Big O complexity is O(logn)
